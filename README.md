![Dashboard for your ▲ now deployments](/static/header.png)

## Objective

Originally this was intended to be a quick read-only web interface to seeing current deployments and projects being hosted on [now.sh](http://now.sh) but with more projects came a need to be in the same UI to make changes instead of switching to the command line.
